            the scheduler returns the actual runtime.
        lookahead (`EventTime`): The scheduler will try to place tasks that are within
            the scheduling lookahead (in us) using estimated task release times.
        enforce_deadlines (`bool`): If True then deadlines must be met or else the
            `schedule()` will return None.
        policy (`BranchPredictionPolicy`): The branch prediction policy to use for the
            scheduler if it schedules future tasks.
        branch_prediction_accuracy (`float`): The accuracy of the branch prediction
            policy used by the scheduler.
        retract_schedules (`bool`): If the scheduler schedules future tasks, then
            setting this to `True` enables the scheduler to retract prior scheduling
            decisions before they are actually placed on the WorkerPools.
        release_taskgraphs (`bool`): If `True`, the scheduler is given access to the
            entire TaskGraph for any Task that falls within the lookahead defined above.
        _flags (`Optional[absl.flags]`): The runtime flags that are used to initialize
