        enforce_deadlines (`bool`): If True then deadlines must be met or else the
            `schedule()` will return None.
        retract_schedules (`bool`): If the scheduler schedules future tasks, then
            setting this to `True` enables the scheduler to retract prior scheduling
            decisions before they are actually placed on the WorkerPools.

            that are ready for scheduling. Turning this to `False` turns the scheduler
