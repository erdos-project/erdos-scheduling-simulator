            If -1, the scheduler returns the actual runtime.
        lookahead (`EventTime`): The scheduler will try to place tasks that are within
            the scheduling lookahead (in us) using estimated task release times.
        enforce_deadlines (`bool`): If True then deadlines must be met or else the
            `schedule()` will return None.
        retract_schedules (`bool`): If the scheduler schedules future tasks, then
            setting this to `True` enables the scheduler to retract prior scheduling
            decisions before they are actually placed on the WorkerPools.
        release_taskgraphs (`bool`): If `True`, the scheduler releases the TaskGraphs
            that are ready for scheduling. Turning this to `False` turns the scheduler
            to a task-by-task scheduler that only schedules the available frontier of
            tasks.
        goal (`str`): The goal to use as the optimization objective.
        time_discretization (`EventTime`): The time discretization at which the
            scheduling decisions are made.
        plan_ahead (`EventTime`): The time in the future up to which the time
            discretizations are to be generated for possible placements. The default

            Simulator, then tasks may be dropped that could have otherwise been
            scheduled leading to lower goodput.
        log_to_file (`bool`): If `True`, the scheduler writes the Gurobi search
            log to files with the format "gurobi_{sim_time}.log".
        _flags (`Optional[absl.flags]`): The runtime flags that are used to initialize
            a logger instance.
        plan_ahead_no_consideration_gap (`EventTime`): The time gap after the current
            time for which plan ahead is not considered malleable. Any tasks placed
