    """Implements a STRL-based formulation for the Graphene scheduler.

    The Graphene paper proposes a min-JCT scheduler that works in the following two
    stages:
        1. An Offline stage that constructs an ordering for the Tasks in a DAG assuming
            a completely empty resource-time space, and modifies the DAG structure to
            correspond to the newly created execution ordering.
        2. An Online stage that schedules the tasks of the modified DAG as they are
            released using a packing-aware scheduler.

    To achieve similar goals, we provide a faithful reimplementation of the Graphene
    scheduler using the TetriSched framework:
        1. For the offline stage, we construct a STRL formulation that minimizes the
            makespan of the DAG, and use the TetriSched framework to solve it.
        2. For the online stage, we use the TetriSched framework to schedule the tasks
            of the modified DAG as they are released and maximize packing within a
            given plan-ahead window.
